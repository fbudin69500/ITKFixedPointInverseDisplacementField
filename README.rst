FixedPointInverseDeformationField takes a deformation field as input and
computes the deformation field that is its inverse. If the input deformation
field was mapping coordinates from a space A into a space B, the output of
this filter will map coordinates from the space B into the space A.

To compute the inverse of the given deformation field, the fixed point algorithm by
Mingli Chen, Weiguo Lu, Quan Chen, Knneth J. Ruchala and Gusavo H. Olivera
described in the paper
\"A simple fixed-point approach to invert a deformation field\",
Medical Physics, vol. 35, issue 1, p. 81,
is applied.
